    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is tasty, but for the purists out there -- Cubans do not eat tortillas, sour cream, cheese, etc. Ropa vieja would be served over white rice, with a side of black beans and fried sweet plantains.</p>
    <p>We thought this was average in taste. I cooked this on high for 4 1/2 hours, after which it still wasn't as tender as I was hoping and was quite chewy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds beef flank steak</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add flank steak and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Transfer steak to a slow cooker; pour in beef broth and tomato sauce. Add tomato paste, bell pepper, onion, garlic, cumin, cilantro, olive oil, and vinegar; stir until well blended.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on Low for up to 10 hours, or on High for 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Shred steak in the slow cooker with two forks.</li>
    </ol>
