    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you’re looking for easy, delicious meals, save this one! The prep could not be any quicker or easier, and the flavor is lovely. I served it with rice and asparagus, but it would be tasty over some angel hair or linguini pasta as well.</p>
    <p>If there were a zero rating I would have picked it. This recipe looks good and smells good while cooking but tastes awful because it was much too salty. I have never used a recipe that was so salty as to ruin the flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian dressing (such as Olive Garden℠ Signature Italian Dressing)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir Italian dressing and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in a slow cooker, and pour dressing mixture over chicken. Cover and cook on Low until chicken is tender, no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, about 8 hours.</li>
    </ol>
